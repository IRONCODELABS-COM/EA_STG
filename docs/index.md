ICL EA is a TOGAF subset tailored for guided, measurable delivery. EA is not one topic among many — it is the **governing principle** across every stage of the methodology. EA is present, and governing, from day one.

Your enterprise exists within a wider context of forces and obligations. See [Commercial Enterprise](pages/commercial_enterprise.md) for where the enterprise sits in the global geo-economic continuum.

## The Three Stages

Everything below operates under EA governance. The stages describe your journey from initial assessment to continuous operational delivery.

### Stage 1 — Preparing for the CMM Ladder
{: .stage}

*EA governs: assessment and baseline*

EA leads the assessment of your current organisational maturity. Where are you on M0–M5?

- EA introduces shared vocabulary via [Taxonomy](pages/taxonomy/index.md)
- EA identifies capability gaps using the ACMM scorecard
- EA sets a realistic target (typically M2)

**Deliverable:** CMM baseline assessment + EA-guided improvement roadmap

For full detail on the maturity model see [CMM](pages/cmm.md).

### Stage 2 — Climbing to CMM Level 2
{: .stage}

*EA governs: process definition and governance*

EA defines and documents architecture processes — moving the organisation from ad-hoc to repeatable.

- EA establishes governance structures and secures senior management involvement
- EA introduces architecture communication practices across the organisation
- EA builds the [Taxonomy](pages/taxonomy/index.md) as a living organisational asset

**Deliverable:** organisation operating at M2 with EA-documented processes

For full detail see [CMM](pages/cmm.md).

### Stage 3 — The BPT Infinity Loop
{: .stage}

*EA governs: continuous operational cycle*

This is the operational methodology for CMM-ready organisations. EA is the **meta-layer** — it does not participate in the loop, it governs it.

| Activity | What happens | Key actors |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Require** | Business declares product needs; EA ensures alignment with strategy | Business, EA |
| **Develop** | Technology builds to product specifications; EA governs coherence | Technology, Product, EA |
| **Deploy** | Product is released into operations; EA validates architecture compliance | Technology, Product, EA |
| **Evaluate** | Measure outcomes against business objectives; feed back into next cycle | Business, Product, EA |

Evaluate feeds back to Require — the loop never stops.

**Actor roles:**

- **Business** — declares products, owns outcomes
- **Product** — bridges business needs and technical capabilities (the alignment point)
- **Technology** — implements products
- **EA** — governs the meta-layer, guides all transitions without bottlenecking

See [BPT Meta Loop](pages/bpt.md) for the diagram and full conceptual description.

## [AI is inside](pages/AI.md)

- Our guiding principle is to understand why and how we and our customers use AI.
- We are not used by AI.
- If things go wrong we do not blame it on AI.
- AI is marketing term. LLM is engineering.
- We do not blame it on the tool.
