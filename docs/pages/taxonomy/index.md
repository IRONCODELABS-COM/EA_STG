## What is a Taxonomy?

- A taxonomy is a hierarchical organizational framework for structuring information across various systems
- In commercial enterprised it is used to solve business problems like improving data discovery, knowledge management, and content governance.
     - It provides a predefined classification system that categorizes technical assets, documentation, and resources from general to specific topics, enabling IT organizations to efficiently organize, locate, and reuse information.

- Taxonomy is GPS of the Information Space. It is essential business "tool" for locating information (hence the GPS analogy)
- Simple well defined Taxonomy is applicable for various types of business activities, undertaken by various actors in the business information space.
- Taxonomy does exist but it is not visible. It is underlying mesh holding the ibusiness information space together

### IT Taxonomies represent structured organizational schemes that can cover various IT domains. 

Through four key IT architectural categories

1. **concepts** (foundational principles and business requirements),
1. **logical** architecture (system designs and relationships),
1. **physical** architecture (infrastructure and deployment models), and
1. **implementation** architecture ( internal software technologies and **deployment**).

This top level, simple progression supports better decision-making and operational efficiency by creating intuitive pathways for information access, while helping organizations maintain consistency in how technical knowledge is classified, shared, and leveraged across different teams and systems.

### Software Taxonomy

Please notice the overarching technology neutral terminology. Taxonomy as a concept is applicable across the various disciplines. Anything that can be defined and stored following the common logic of classification aka “taxonomy”. Of course here we are primarily concerned with software in particular and IT in general.

IT Architecture Delivers Software. In a series of planned multidisciplinary activities, executed by a team of Actors organized in four categories naming the roles.

As any other complex system, software is planned and delivered in a sequence of steps From higher to lower levels on abstraction

Our 4 categories are actuially progression through levels of abstractions. From the most abstract to the least abstract level. We are manadating 4 levels:

> `Conceptual → Logical → Physical → Implementation`
>
>  “From idea to the product”

As Organization IT Landscape Classification, Taxonomy is essential for cataloguing and ordering. This is essential activity before any kind of feasible IT management can start.

As Architecture classification logic, taxonomy hierarchy is essential for software product development management. As it describes the information content of deliverables each stage should produce

## The Taxonomy hierarchy

> **NOTE**
> Shared simple Taxonomy is most important communication asset in your organization
{: .note}

- Use this is the simple primary source of truth, on taxonomy, in your organization 
  - Use those terms as common vocabulary
  - it is extremely important to share simple common vocabulary
- **Taxonomy is a  hierarchical structure. First level of the hierarchy is called “Categories”, second level is called “Capabilities”**
- Capabilities added, are turning the four top level categories into full software taxonomy.
- Taxonomy “category” together with ts four “capability” siblings is a complete definition for a single category.
- this Taxonomy is applicable to wide spectra of organization activities
  - and roles performing those activities
