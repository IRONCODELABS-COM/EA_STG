# CLAUDE.md

This repo contains only documentation (markdown files and media). No code.

The primary focus is **enterprise architecture** and **methodology** — not software or technical architecture.

## Architecture levels (highest to lowest abstraction)

When writing or organizing architectural content, place each concern at the correct level of abstraction. Do not mix levels within the same section.

1. **Conceptual Architecture** — business capabilities, domain boundaries, strategic alignment
2. **Logical Architecture** — component relationships, data flows, integration patterns, information architecture
3. **Physical Architecture** — deployment topology, infrastructure, network
4. **Software Architecture** — code structure, layering, dependency rules (rarely the focus here)

Architecture and engineering are distinct disciplines. Architecture defines *what* the system is and *how it is structured*; engineering defines *how it is built, operated, and kept healthy*. Keep them clearly separated in all documents.

## Output

- be succinct
- pay attention to kramdown vs markdown differences
