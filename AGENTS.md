# AGENTS.md

Rules for AI agents (and humans) working in this enterprise architecture and methodology repository.

## Content scope

This repo contains documentation only — markdown files and media. No code.

Primary focus: **enterprise architecture** and **methodology**. Software/technical architecture is secondary.

## Architecture taxonomy

All architectural content must be placed at the correct level of abstraction. Do not mix levels within a single document or section.

1. **Conceptual** — business capabilities, domain boundaries, strategic alignment
2. **Logical** — component relationships, data flows, integration patterns, information architecture
3. **Physical** — deployment topology, infrastructure, network
4. **Software** — code structure, layering, dependency rules (rarely the focus here)

When a document spans multiple levels, use separate sections with clear headings.

## Architecture vs Engineering

Architecture defines *what* the system is and *how it is structured*.
Engineering defines *how it is built, operated, and kept healthy*.

Keep these disciplines clearly separated. Do not conflate architectural decisions with engineering practices.

## Document structure

- Use descriptive file names: `topic_subtopic.md` (snake_case)
- Start each document with a level-1 heading (`#`) matching the topic
- Include a brief summary or purpose statement near the top
- Use level-2 headings (`##`) for major sections
- Prefer lists and tables over dense prose

## Cross-references

- Link to related documents using relative paths
- When referencing external sources, include the URL and access date
- Do not create orphan documents — every document should be discoverable from an index or parent

## Quality standards

- **Draft** documents should be marked with `[DRAFT]` in the title or a front-matter flag
- **Complete** documents should be self-contained enough to be useful without requiring verbal explanation
- Avoid jargon without definition; if a term is domain-specific, define it on first use or link to a glossary
